    "This notebook provides a fully automated therapy system that:\n",
    "1. Conducts intake sessions with AI conversation\n",
    "2. Automatically determines appropriate assessments\n",
    "3. Selects optimal therapy modality (CBT, DBT, ACT, Psychodynamic)\n",
    "4. Generates SMART treatment goals\n",
    "5. Creates personalized homework assignments\n",
    "6. Tracks progress and adjusts treatment plans\n",
    "7. Conducts follow-up sessions automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "TO USE:\n",
    "1. Set your Gemini API key in the environment or pass it directly\n",

      "**Guiding Principles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Empathy and Validation:** Continue to express empathy and validate the patient's feelings. Let them know that their reaction is understandable given the circumstances.\n",
      "*   **Gentle Probing:** Ask questions in a gentle and non-judgmental way. Be careful not to push the patient too hard if they seem reluctant to talk about certain topics.\n",
      "*   **Normalize Grief:** Normalize the grieving process. Let the patient know that it's normal to experience a wide range of emotions after a breakup, including sadness, anger, confusion, and loneliness.\n",
      "*   **Reiterate Support:** Remind the patient that you're there to support them and help them through this difficult time.\n",
      "*   **Offer Practical Suggestions (Later):** Once you have a better understanding of the patient's symptoms and experiences, you can start to offer practical suggestions for managing their grief, improving their sleep, and coping with their work stress. However, it's important to prioritize listening and understanding before offering advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "By continuing to explore these areas with sensitivity and care, you can help the patient feel heard, understood, and supported. This will also provide you with the information you need to develop an effective treatment plan that addresses their specific needs and goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI Therapist: Okay, the patient stating \"let's stop here\" is a clear signal that they are feeling overwhelmed or uncomfortable. It's crucial to respect their boundaries and avoid pushing them further than they are willing to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapist: \"Okay, I understand. Thank you for letting me know. It takes courage to share what you've been sharing, and it's perfectly alright to take a break when you need one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we pause completely, I want to acknowledge that you've shared some really important and difficult things today. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pain and distress related to the breakup, the constant reminders, and the impact on your sleep. I appreciate you being so open with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure I'm understanding everything correctly and to help us pick up where we left off next time, would it be okay if I just briefly summarized what I've heard so far? And then perhaps we can decide together what you would like to focus on in our next session?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**If the patient agrees (and only if they agree):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapist (if patient agrees): \"Okay, great. From what you've told me, it sounds like:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The breakup is significantly impacting your daily life.** The memories, triggered by things like her perfume, are intrusive and emotionally overwhelming, leading to a downward spiral in your mood.\n",
      "*   **You're experiencing intense grief**, characterized by frequent crying, particularly at night, and potential sleep disturbances.\n",
      "*   **You're struggling with possible symptoms of depression**, though we need to explore this further.\n",
      "*   **And work may be contributing** to the exhaustion and sense of being overwhelmed, though we haven't fully explored that yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does that summary feel accurate to you? Is there anything I missed or misunderstood?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Based on the Patient's Response:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **If the patient says the summary is accurate:** \"Okay, thank you for confirming that. Given everything we've discussed today, what feels like the most pressing issue for you to address in our next session? Would you like to focus on the grief, the sleep problems, or something else entirely? Or would you like me to come up with some ideas?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **If the patient corrects the summary:** \"Thank you for clarifying that. I want to make sure I understand you completely. [Incorporate the correction into the summary and repeat the summary]. Okay, with that updated summary, what feels like the most pressing issue for you to address in our next session? Would you like to focus on the grief, the sleep problems, or something else entirely? Or would you like me to come up with some ideas?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Concluding the Session (Regardless of the Patient's Response to the Summary):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapist: \"Okay, whatever you'd like to focus on is fine. For now, it sounds like you need a break, and that's perfectly okay. Remember, this is a process, and we can take it at your pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we end, I want to remind you that you're not alone in this, and I'm here to support you. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or having thoughts of hurting yourself before our next session, please reach out to the crisis hotline at 988, or go to the nearest emergency room. Is that okay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapist: \"Our next appointment is scheduled for [Date and Time]. In the meantime, try to be gentle with yourself. Even small acts of self-compassion can make a difference. Things like taking a warm bath, listening to some soothing music, or spending time in nature. Focus on small wins, and remember that it's okay to ask for help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any questions for me before we end for today? No worries if not. I'll see you next time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations for Future Sessions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Start Slow:** Begin the next session by acknowledging the previous session's ending and validating the patient's feelings.\n",
      "*   **Re-establish Safety:** Reiterate the importance of creating a safe and comfortable space for the patient to share their thoughts and feelings.\n",
      "*   **Collaborative Agenda:** Work collaboratively with the patient to set the agenda for the session.\n",
      "*   **Pace and Boundaries:** Continue to respect the patient's pace and boundaries.\n",
      "*   **Offer Hope:** Gently remind the patient that therapy can be effective in helping them manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.\n",
      "*   **Consider a more structured assessment tool**: such as the PHQ-9 or GAD-7, if the patient is comfortable. This will help to quantify and track progress.\n",
      "*   **Safety Plan**: Discuss and develop a safety plan, if not already done.\n",
      "\n",
      "By being sensitive, respectful, and collaborative, you can help the patient feel more comfortable and empowered in the therapeutic process. This will ultimately lead to better outcomes.\n",
